    <textOnly>Hi {!FieloPRP__Invoice__c.FieloPRP__Member__r.Name},

Your proof of purchase has been submitted and will be approved right away. You’re doing a great job and getting the hang of this fast. You’ll have points in no time.

The more invoices you upload, the more points you’ll unlock - getting you one step closer to rewards from our catalog.

We’ll keep you posted as soon as your invoice has been processed.

All the best,

&lt;Company Name&gt;</textOnly>
